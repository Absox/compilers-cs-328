600.328 Compilers & Intepreters, Homework 9
Ran Liu (rliu14@jhu.edu)

I do some ugly symbol table lookup and use polymorphism to differentiate local
variables. I also immediately move the parameters from their original locations
onto the stack, so that the offsets that the code generator gets make sense.

Language Options:
All

I implement procedures for:
Interpreter (Complete)
Advanced Code Generator (Complete)
Basic Code Generator (Not started)

10k lines into software development is generally a bad time to realize you
should have refactored a long time ago. I wish I were better at C++ back then.

Somehow, I seem to have introduced a memory leak into the program.
This is despite the fact that I only ever use shared pointers.
So I'm not really sure how this happened. Valgrind isn't very informative about
it, except that it seems to happen in my Parser. Yet I didn't really change
too much about the parser...
