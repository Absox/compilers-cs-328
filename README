600.328 Compilers & Intepreters, Homework 9
Ran Liu (rliu14@jhu.edu)

Somehow, I seem to have introduced a 72-byte memory leak into my program. I
haven't the slightest clue how; valgrind seems to think that it's in the parser.
However, I only ever use smart pointers to allocate memory.

I do some ugly symbol table lookup and use polymorphism to differentiate local
variables. I also immediately move the parameters from their original locations
onto the stack, so that the offsets that the code generator gets make sense.
