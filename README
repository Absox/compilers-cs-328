Type inference (auto keyword) is pretty nice in C++. I was hoping for
something similar to the diamond operator in Java, but the auto keyword is
even better than that. Supposedly a similar feature is coming to Java 9.

I can't really help the creeping sensation that what I've been doing is bad
object-oriented design, though, what with all the type checking. Perhaps using
dependency injection, rather than making the symbol table, abstract syntax tree,
etc. members of the Parser could have remedied this solution. I.e. we generate
expressions, locations, etc using a Factory with dependency on the SymbolTable.
Unfortunately, I didn't quite have the foresight for that.

Dependency injection in C++ also tends to increase program complexity. Though
I suppose it could be done somewhat easily with the aid of smart pointers.
Actually, this program is already growing a bit too complex for my liking.
I really hope that there won't be too many further modifications to the Parser.
