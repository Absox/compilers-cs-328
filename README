600.328 Compilers & Intepreters, Homework 9
Ran Liu (rliu14@jhu.edu)

Somehow, I seem to have introduced a 72-byte memory leak into my program. I
haven't the slightest clue how; valgrind seems to think that it's in the parser.
However, I only ever use smart pointers to allocate memory.

I do some ugly symbol table lookup and use polymorphism to differentiate local
variables. I also introduce some inefficiency by pushing all the parameters,
then popping them off at the beginning of the procedure into the intended
locations.

As far as I can tell, I implement all the language options.
I've implemented procedures for the interpreter, as well as the advanced
code generator.

I'd like to refactor my entire program, but the time limitations of this course
prevent me from doing that, especially now that we're at the point that I have
nearly 10k lines of code.

As a digression- if we rely on direct access granted to friend classes rather
than using mutators/accessors, how do we unit test our classes? I suppose we
can unit test only what we expose as a public interface, but we don't write in
any public interfaces... I suppose then we essentially just have a struct.
