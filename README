600.328 Compilers & Intepreters, Homework 9
Ran Liu (rliu14@jhu.edu)

Somehow, I seem to have introduced a 72-byte memory leak into my program. I
haven't the slightest clue how; valgrind seems to think that it's in the parser.
However, I only ever use smart pointers to allocate memory. Also it's always
the same 72 bytes.

I do some ugly symbol table lookup and use polymorphism to differentiate local
variables. I also immediately move the parameters from their original locations
onto the stack, so that the offsets that the code generator gets make sense.

Language Options:
All

I implement procedures for:
Interpreter (Complete)
Advanced Code Generator (Complete with Integer parameters; working on Array
and Record parameters)
Basic Code Generator (Not started)

10k lines into software development is generally a bad time to realize you
should have refactored a long time ago. I wish I were better at C++ back then.
