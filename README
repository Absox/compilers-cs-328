Type inference (auto keyword) is pretty nice in C++. I was hoping for
something similar to the diamond operator in Java, but the auto keyword is
even better than that. Supposedly a similar feature is coming to Java 9.

Unfortunately, separating your source files into different directories
when they're interdependent is a little bit harder than in Java. I'm sure
there's some way to do it with CMake.
