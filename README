600.328 Compilers & Intepreters, Homework 6

I opted out of explicitly defining a stack for the interpreter. While I
understand the concept, having to put various boxes as well as integers and
expression nodes onto the stack would require defining some encapsulating
super type. It seemed like more of a bother than it was worth.

If building the code generator does require something more explicit, then
I can always write the code for it then.

There's a lot of typecasting of pointers in my implementation, but I'm not
sure this could have been avoided, not without a fundamental redesign of
the entire system. As-is, the implementation was fairly simple overall. The
assignment was much less work than the AST, which took me on the order of 12
or so development hours.

I kind of wish I'd come up with a better directory structure.
